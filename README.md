### **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System â€“ Note**

The Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system is designed to automatically detect and read vehicle license plates from images or video feeds. It uses a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques to perform tasks such as image preprocessing, license plate localization, character segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR). The system is capable of working in real-time and can adapt to various conditions like lighting, weather, and camera angles. ANPR is widely used in traffic monitoring, law enforcement, parking management, and security systems to identify and track vehicles efficiently.
